# Store App Example
Basic backbone.js and node.js example for REST based Store application.

### Installation
#### Install Prerequisites
Before you get started, you will need to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) if you haven't already done so.

Once you've got both Git and Node.js installed, the other components you'll need can be installed with the Node Package Manager - AKA [npm](https://npmjs.org/) - which **comes installed with Node.js**

To install the dependencies, run the following command - which can be done via Terminal on OS X or on Windows via whatever command line utility was installed.

```bash
npm install bower -g
```

#### Install Module Dependencies
With the extracted folder as your current working directory, run the following command.
```bash
npm install
bower install
```

### Viewing the output
To view the output create a local server:
```bash
node server
```
